## The Museum of Riga History and Navigation - what can be done. PART 1

![Museum of Rigas History and Navigation](/RVKM.jpg)

In my Digital humanities studies we have course in AI, we had a task to think about using AI in somewhere. I had an idea -  is it possible to use AI to modernize
and digitze museum, to develop museum in the new light?
 
In here, today, I will post all information I have gathered up till now, learning about technologies through few examples on the covered topic.
I would like to mention that this topic is a **draft**, and I am updating it with new information and conculsions all the time. 

!NB There are mistakes in my langugage, and in some moments it seems like I have had too much wine. (That happens when you have too much in mind)

#### Topic - Artificial intelligence in museum environment. Possibilities of AI implementation in the Museum of Riga History and Navigation


**Abstract**

Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a powerful tool being used all around us, but it is not exactly new. It is known that museums and other cultural institutions are using newest technologies for modernization and digitalization purposes in our modern era.  My topic Idea is to see and research possibilities of artificial intelligence implementation in the museum, to see AI usage examples in other museums and learn from them, of course if they are using this kind of technology. 
In this topic I will try to see what possibilities of AI usage are real in museum, and what type of AI, programs and for what purposes it is needed for better and more exiting work environment in museum, for both visitors and employees. 
Modernization of museum, in times of digital era, is one of the main tasks and goals to achieve, it is not needed only for entertainment of visitors, but for preservation and digitalization of historical objects. 
What I know? And what I see? As an employee of the museum, It is a struggle to know what type technologies in modernization process is needed and is best to use, if there no professional in museum to provide help and knowledge, and where to get help for better solutions in usage of modern technologies like AI, there isn't much employees with zero or minimal knowledge can do. I want to learn and research possibilities of AI or other modern technology usage in the museum environment.

**The significance and topicality**

The chosen topic is very much based on the great need for modernization in my workplace in the Museum of Riga History and Navigation, this urge is affecting the whole workplace together. We had had long discussions on how to make museum better place, using modern technologies starting with databases type systems, 3d implementations and ending with something similar to Artificial Intelligence (AI), which  would help employees of the museum work easier and faster, and in the end AI could be used as something, that would even 'serve' visitors of the museum. 
Modernization of museum, in times of digital era, is one of the main tasks and goals to achieve, it is not needed only for entertainment of visitors, but for preservation and digitalization and researching of historical objects. The Museum of Riga History and Navigation is one of the oldest museums in the Baltic states and one of the most 'behind the time' in developing something modern and new, like system type databases etc. Idea would not only affect 'physical museum', but museums webpage or social media.
Topic is about 'possibilities' of implementation of AI in the museum, because it is hard work where are needed finaces, projects and understanding, and the desire to achieve planned. I will try to find and research what  possibilities of AI usage are real in museum, and what type of AI, programs and for what purposes it is needed for better and more exiting work environment in museum, for both visitors and employees. There are a lot of research about modern technology influence on culture and life of the museums. It is important to understand and research these modern tendencies, to even start implementing these modern ideas in museum, to learn from other experiences.
Artificial intelligence is modern and most complex 'digitalization' in one way, and to implement it in work environment, museum have to 'learn' these technologies, and with AI help, museum can preserve museum collections to keep it safe. Other possibility is to show artefacts - hidden museum treasures to visitors, for example system, AI  (created person, let's say like that) gives a tour inside museum collection rooms, where no visitor can go inside, with possibilities to answer simple or not too complex questions. This idea skipped in my head at first, when thought about AI implementation, and this idea strengthen in the article 'Virtual museums', a survey and some issues for consideration', where was said, that it is possible to have Meta-Museum guide system that is based on Augmented Reality and AI technologies, which provides a communication environment between the real world and cyberspace to maximize the utilization of a museum's archives and knowledge base.   

**Main paragraph**

To know how modern technologies and artificial intelligence works in the museums, it is important to look at the examples, if there are any museums with this kind of advanced technology 
or not, is it possible to implement or either impossible to implement in museum system. My example, the Museum of Riga History and Navigation cannot make any modernization developments, 
or let's say correctly struggles of modern technology implementation, because of lack of understanding of the newest tendencies and lack of consultations with professionals, but that is only matter of time, 
cause I believe it is possible to change that, starting with small and ending, I hope in future to create artificial intelligence that would help develop  modern workspace.
All kind of museums are interested in the digitizing of their collections not only for the sake of preserving the cultural heritage, but to also make the information content accessible to the
 wider public in a manner that is attractive, modern and is engaging the audience of different age. Evolving modern technologies, such as Virtual Reality (VR),  Augmented reality (AG)  and three-dimensional (3D),
 and even Artificial Intelligence (AI) are widely used to create virtual museum exhibitions both in a museum environment through informative media and on the internet. In this sense artificial intelligence is more 
known as machine learning systems, that can help in developing interesting, engaging, educational systems for positive experiences. 
At start we could look at different types of digital development technologies to better understand what it is and how it works, and how it impacts museum life. 
First step for modernizing digital technologies implementations, in my opinion, could start with one of the most common and easiest to achieve technology - three-dimensional (3D),
 to see, how 'heart' of the museum reacts to this kind of development.  Why? Because, with the intense and fast development of 3D digital technology, is more and more valued by people, not only 
by employees but visitors of the museum too. At these times, it has become important part and the most important research and application direction in the field of multimedia applications used in culture. 
Because 3D is more intuitive than a flat image, flat story, it can give the viewer a sense of immersion, especially for items that cannot be fully displayed for various reasons, to see them, and almost touch them. 

Of course, there are many museums using digital, modern technologies. Are future museums and designing futuristic museums possible? And will it make working in museum more productive in all kinds of fields, and will museum be better in educating students, children, everyone, but to even start steps of modernization museum have to know its goal and mission. 
Hardest part is to understand what we, as a museum, which does not have any knowledge of modern technology improvements, can we do? We have to understand, that this modernization development is not cheap, 
but it comes with expenses, we need to know were we can go to apply for projects that finances these kind of things, and what company would be interested to help museum achieve this, or what we by ourselves, 
can invest form our budget.  This is the hardest step in whole modernization in the Museum of Riga History and Navigation. Museum has many sections where we could use technological development, like for example,
 in archeology department, numismatics department, furniture collections, documents and photography collections, or navigation department and other spheres. We need to know how much everyone is willing to 
invest with their own resources (time, ideas, work) to make digital modernization happen, starting with 3D implementation and ending in the future with simple artificial intelligence. 

Futher I will look in to one of the research papers about AI usage in museums.
Chosen paper analyses the application of artificial intelligence techniques to various areas of archaeology and more like the use of software tools as a creative stimulus for the organization of exhibitions,  the use of humanoid robots and holographic displays as guides that interact and involve museum visitors, the analysis of methods for the classification of fragments found in archaeological excavations and for the reconstruction of ceramics, and this would be one of the starting points of using and implement AI in our museum work, because we have a lot of ceramics, that is, pottery and it is in urgent need to reconstruction. Reconstruction would help understanding more correctly that times history, and with gained knowledge we could provide this information even further. 

Authors give straight facts of Algorithms for AI to understand in this process of reconstruction. 
*'The classification of ceramics can be defined as the practice of describing and arranging the artefacts found in taxonomic groups, and observing and comparing different characteristics of the same.
Artefacts are classified based on information:*

*1.Structural refers to the geometric structure.*

*2.Mereological belongs to the relationship between different parts that make up the artefact.*

*3.Morphological is related to the form.*

*4.Functionals are related to the function of the artefact.*

*5.Materials refer to the chemical-physical composition and the material with which the objects are made.'*   

Of course there is more to algorithm, important is approach, that represents suitable language (machine-readable), there is needed knowledge base, important is data mining for There have even been special projects, like ArchAIDE ( Archaeological Automatic Interpretation and Documentation of cEramics), idea behind ArchAIDE to support the classification and interpretation work of the archeologist with innovative IT tools for the automatic recognition of archeological ceramics, through the development of a software platform available on mobile devices and on desktop computer.

**Photo** *Screenshots of the ArchAIDE app available on the Play Store. After taking a photo of the fragment to be recognized, recognition is activated via the Classify option. The system returns the five most probable results with relative percentage, the user can validate the answer by comparing the fragment with the database images*

The classification of ceramics is of fundamental importance for understanding and dating archeological contexts and for understanding the dynamics of production, commercial flows, and commercial interactions. The digital automation of this process could revolutionize archeological practice, reducing time and costs, improving access and enhancement of the digital cultural heritage in a sustainable way, and allowing a deeper knowledge of archeological contexts. Similar type of project would be opportunity for our archaeologist to create and modernize archeological performance in the museum. This type of AI usage would be great step forward for museum development in digitalization and modern technology era.
 Next step which would apply to our museum, given this article, is  the cataloging and study of human remains to understand the social and historical context of belonging with the demonstration of the effectiveness using AI techniques, and showing AI opportunities in research. And indeed, our archeologists are studying human remains, to replicate their lifestyle, living conditions, health, food, and more, but for now it difficult to do precise analyses and research without modern technological help. This would mostly apply to archeology department of the Museum of Riga History and Navigation. It is worth mention that archeology department works hands in hands with navigation department, and this kind of project similar to ArchAIDE, would greatly help in improving history research even in underwater sites, which we have a lot, because Riga is port city from early times.
