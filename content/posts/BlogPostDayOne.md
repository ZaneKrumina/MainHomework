## Digital Humanities

This is my First blog about my studies in Digital humanities
Digital humanities is course where I am learning about - well 'Digital humanities' 
In here I will use my new knowledge to research and learn about topic of my liking - **Museums and technologies.**
Using:
* Github, Gitbash;

* Hugo;

* Atom; 

* Mother Google;

* and other interesting "things"  whith whom I have to show my understanding.

Let's say, I am pure "humanitarian", so I struggle alot, but I find this task interesting to do.

My first blog will be about my idea and introduction of topic I want to look more into. I am using Hugo to create my blog, posts are markdown files,
where I pu tinformation about topic, with simple edditing, I cna create simple yet decent webpage. Everytime after i Update my information I will update it,
so it is up to date in mu Github account.

### Intrudutcion - Museum technologies and digital humanities

One of the intersting information I could find about digital humanities is: *MCN's 2018 conference, Humanizing the Digital*.
I will not discuss everything about this conference here, will give you insight of it - *What is it about.*
![MCN's](/Konference.jpg)

MCN's 2018 conference, Humanizing the Digital, explored how museums can use technology to foster human connection and dialogue, advance accessibility and inclusion, and champion inquiry and knowledge. After witnessing the presentations and rich conversations that arose from them, 
a group of practitioners came together to explore how best to capture and disseminate the learnings that occurred at the conference. The outcome was a decision
to solicit and publish a book inspired by the conference and its ideas. Humanizing the Digital: Unproceedings from the MCN 2018 Conference contains 17 conference-inspired
responses to the state of museum technology in 2018, including essays, reflections, case studies, conversations, and an experimental in-book zine. The topics explore areas
as diverse as calm technology, Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, visitor-centered communication, interpretation and programming, empathy, inclusion and slow change.

*Humanizing the Digital* marked a bit of a rhetorical about-face. For most of its short history, museum technology has been about 'digitizing the human.' 
Technologists endeavored to bring digital tools to bear on the mission of museums, in service of cultural heritage. At first that meant digitizing cultural 
collections, creating digital images and converting ledgers and card catalogues into databases. About 10 years ago, the process accelerated and gathered momentum, 
to include websites,  social media, in-gallery interactives, and even museum processes and approaches. In the last two years, as the failings of digital culture
have become shockingly apparent,  we've seen a shift.

What if the most pressing problem today isn't the lack of digital tools in cultural heritage,
but rather the lack of humanity in digital culture? Are museum technologists in a unique position
to critique and change digital culture?

*I looked into most of the topics I were intereseted in and thought will be usefull for my job in the museum, even if those are theoretcial ideas, but that is start of everything.*
