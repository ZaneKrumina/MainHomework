## Digital Humanities

This is my First blog about my studies in DIgital humanities
This where I am learning, where i use my knowledge to research topic of my liking. 
Using Github, Gitbash, Hugo, Atom and other interesting "things" I have to show 
my understanding of things (even if i do not understand :D ) 
Let's say, I am pure "humanitarian, so i struggle alot.
My first blog will be about my idea of topic I want to look more into,
Struggles of how to use something I have never used, and this an that
Post my progression, achievements and more.

### Topic - Museum technologies.





### What to do? How to do?
