## The Museum of Riga History and Navigation up till now.

### What is done up till now in the field of modernization and digital development in the museum?

* Up till know in the Museum of Riga History and Navigation only modern, but already outdated technology are QR codes, which are
implemented in exposition halls, and, to be honest,execution is not satisfactory, because of lack of knowledge on what information put there. There are room for improvements, but from our faults we learn.
One of the main problems are budget. Because of the budget our QR codes only show artefacts with no aditional information and history added. From our 3 QR codes 2 of them are same as the artefacts put in the showcase, 
and only one is artefact (costume) which is not seen anywhere, because of the artefacts fragile state, this object is only one, I believe is unique, but then again, it lacks legend or history added to it.
Using mobile phones everyone can zoom in/out and rotate objetcs in Qr codes.
Here are some pictures (bad quality because of the lighning and place where objects are set),with examples. 
I am dissapointed, that noone keeps an eye on the condition of the QR codes, because when I checked, one of the three codes did not work. ( I think janitor cleaned it too good ) If we want to maintain, and have modern technologies, and develop as something modern,
we have to keep them in good condition. But I see opportunities to become better - with working together.

* One of the big "hits", is our new Rigas history and Navigation museum [webpage](http://www.rigamuz.lv/). Stuggles, difficulties, misunderstandings about creation of the home pages caused various discussions, 
but in the end, thanks to a responsive and knowledgeable  persons who knew how to create websites, we managed to get a new, beautiful and easy-to-understand website as a museum. This was another step towards modernization,
and employee understanding of modern things.

* More successful, with digital and modern technology usage, succeed exhibition "Kur gusu Latvijas speku" (Where will I get strength for Latvia). It was our first and succesfull project creating exhibition using modern technologies,
primitive ones - but result gave new breath to our museum. We had ear-phones where you could listen to the sotries of main characters of the exhibition, using tablet it was possible to change whose story to listen. 
We had movie on big screen to relax and watch about Latvias history, touchscreens to swipe along and zoom in/out paintings and drawings, look through "Gold donation book" and search people by they surnames, maybe some even found their relatives
from long ago. This exhibition was one of the first and succesfull ones, created in our museum using technologies. Historical event, I would say. We were proud. From here we want to go even further and more voluminously.

* One of the most recent exhibitions is "ILGUCIEMA STIKLS" or "ILGUCIEMS GLASSWARE (1886-1960)". In there we may have not used full potential of modern technologies, but with our web-page, we can  introduce and share information with everyone
about [this beautifull historical exhibition](http://www.rigamuz.lv/rvkm/en/whats-on/ilguciems-glassware-1886-1960/). Here it is possible to see some of the potential our web-page has, AND beautiful photos made by our digitization
team. Yes, Yes, i know, i am too proud about small things, but those are the best one, am I right?

### Plans? Yes!

* In 2020 we started to working together with company [Vividly](https://www.vividlyapp.com/) to create 3d interavtive experience in the museum.
Becasue of the Covid situation our work on our first 3d artefact representation dragged on throughout the year. But now everything is going good.
For our first pilot project we are using one of the most rarest and unique artefact 'Madonna uz meness sirpja' (Madonna on the moon sickle). Idea is to 
create 3d object and post it in webpage and later on after covid situation to place it in museum on tha tablet, so people can interact with the object.
First step is to create usable 3D object (which we have, but I cannot publish it here for now - *copyrights* )  and create article with history and myth, and other stories about specific object, article is meant to be published in 
Vividly page, and in the museum web-page.
Article should look similair to [this.](https://www.vividlyapp.com/muzejiem/corona-vase?fbclid=IwAR3GpanoJIMTBxbATf1Wo_TT70u_hWrx0-IscvG4egfzyBFBs89RffKWCpI), interactive 3D file, high quality pictures,
history and interesting facts. This one type of modern technology implementation in the museum, even if it is small step. With this we are giving othe opportunity for both staff and visitors of the museum
to get used to the news by providing each other with support and knowledge about modernization. 


### Museum environment development.

* We are doing our best to create interesting enviroment with technologies for visitors in the museum, but, in my opinion, it is importatn to create modern
workplace for museum employees, and help them to adapt to something new. So we have few youngsters studying technologies and digital humanities,
to share new knowledge with everyione in the museum, having discussions and helping each other out.
