### What is done up till now in modernization and digital development in the museum?

QR


### Plan? Yes!

In 2020 we started to working together with company Vividly (add link here) to create 3d interavtive experience in the museum.
Becasue of the Covid situation our work on our first 3d artefact representation dragged on throughout the year. But now everything is going good.
For our first pilot project we are using one of the most rarest and unique artefact 'Madonna uz meness sirpja' (Madonna on the moon sickle). Idea is to 
create 3d object and post it in webpage and later on after covid situation to place it in museum on tha tablet, so people can interact with object.


### Museum environment development.

We are doing our best to create interesting enviroment with technologies for visitors in the museum, but, in my opinion, it is importatn to create modern
workplace for museum employees, and help them to adapt to something new.
