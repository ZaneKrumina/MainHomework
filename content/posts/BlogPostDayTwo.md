## Museum Technologies

Main goal of this post is to understand what is meant by technologies in the museum, and how is it
possible to use them, to modernize museum experience. 

### Lets look at things as whole - What is technology in the museum.

Over the past two decades, technology has cemented itself as one of the most important 
aspects of modern society. From where we stand today it's almost impossible to imagine a life 
unaided by digital devices, the Internet or computing tools. From business and leisure to 
communication and information, our reliance on technology is all consuming in 
almost every aspect of daily life, changing the way we see and interact with the world.
