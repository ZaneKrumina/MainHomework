## Museum Technologies

Main goal of this post is to understand what is meant by technologies in the museum, and how is it
possible to use them, to modernize museum experience. 

### Lets look at things as whole - What is technology in the museum.

#### In the world

In start I will be reffering to the post *"How technology is bringing museum back to life"*

Over the past two decades, technology has cemented itself as one of the most important 
aspects of modern society. From where we stand today it's almost impossible to imagine a life 
unaided by digital devices, the Internet or computing tools. From business and leisure to 
communication and information, our reliance on technology is all consuming in 
almost every aspect of daily life, changing the way we see and interact with the world. 
Yet there are still those who think technology has no place in the museum. With technologies we
can understand things as Virtual reality (VR), Augmented reality (AR), Artificial inteligence (AI)
and even simpler technologies like 3D.

**Technology and the museum experience**

What i can see, that most of museums uses AR and VR technologies, and indeed, they can give impresive visualizations of objects, or events, where you
can interact with history, to feel like part of it. In the world there are many museums who uses these posibilities, and in really good way, so other museums
can learn from them. Ofciurse it is question of knowledge and finances - if you have both - you can have a lot of possibilities. But thanks to those museums
who are actively using technologies, others, like I said, can learn from them. Here are some examples right below.

The likes of **AR** and **VR** are being used by institutions around the world to
make history feel more present both inside and outside the museum space.
On of the examples in article is about year 2019,  where the **Prado Museum** in Madrid introduced its first innovative 360-degree 
immersive experience. This project allowed users to get closer than ever before to the 
artworks and artefacts held in the institution.

**Louvre**, In October 2019, Paris' Louvre launched 'Mona Lisa: Beyond the Glass', a VR experience that explores the Renaissance painting
as part of its Leonardo da Vinci blockbuster exhibition. Through interactive design, sound and animated images, users discover details about the painting,
such as its wood panel texture and how the passage of time has changed the way it looks. Here is provided link about this topic [Mona Lisa: Beyond the Glass at The Louvre I HTC VIVE ARTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au_UpzhzHwk&ab_channel=HTCVIVE)

**Peterson Automotive Museum**
**The Peterson Automotive Museum** in Los Angeles worked with Microsoft HoloLens in 2017 to create a new exhibition. 
The result was an exciting VR experience. Visitors were able to interact with a classic American sports car, the Ford GT40.

This supercar is a fascinating piece of history, and winner of several Le Mans races in the 1960s. The HoloLens allowed visitors to see 
the car up close, alongside a modern 2017 Ford GT for comparison. The exhibition aimed to tell a story, 
by blending the real and the virtual space. Visitors were further drawn into the experience by the addition of spatial audio, or surround 
sound. While learning about the history of the cars, they could also hear the roar of the engines and the sounds of tyres racing around a track.

Terry Karges, the museum's executive director, said the exhibition was a wonderful addition. The museum aims to use more interactive displays such as this, to enhance their storytelling potential.

**The National Museum of Finland** in Helsinki opened a new VR exhibit in 2018. Visitors can head back in time to the year 1863, as they explore R. W. Ekman's painting *The Opening of the Diet 1863 by Alexander II.*
The VR headset allows people to feel as if they are stepping inside the painting. Visitors find themselves within the scene and can look around at the Hall of Mirrors from a 3D perspective. They can even speak with the Russian Emperor and other characters depicted in the painting. It is part of an exhibit detailing Finnish life and politics in the 1860s, under the Russian Empire.

**IN LATVIA**

Here in Latvia we have succesful experience in **VR** technologies in museum. As far as I know, thanks to [Vividly](https://www.vividlyapp.com/),
**Talsu hisotry Museum** created immersive **VR** experience, implementing it in the exhibition "Celojums senatne" it could be transalted as journey to past.
The exposition tells story about the ancient history of the county from the 9th century b.c. up to the 18th century. It is based on the museum collection of archeological objects and deposits
from the Latvian National Museum of History. The exposition provides an opportunity to watch an animated film about fishing in ancient history, you can put a pot of fragments of clay, 
discover  "treasures" with the help of air flow, and work with multimedia exhibits and **VR** glasses.
