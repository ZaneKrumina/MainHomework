## The Museum of Riga History and Navigation part 2

I have almost finished my topic in AI course. But I will post updated information here, still in draft.

**NB!** There will be similair information to PART 1, but ... information is updated.

As for my defense, there are many things I still do not understand within my topic, but I hope I will eventually understand it.

### ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MUSEUM ENVIRONMENT

To know how modern technologies and artificial intelligence works in the museums, it is important to look at the examples, if there are any museums with this kind of advanced technology or not, is it possible to implement
 or either impossible to implement in museum system. My example, the Museum of Riga History and Navigation cannot make any modernization developments, or let's say correctly - struggles of modern technology implementation,
 because of lack of understanding of the newest tendencies and lack of consultations with professionals, but that is only matter of time, cause I believe it is possible to change everything, starting with small steps like
  usage of digital display technology, and ending with creation of somewhat artificial intelligence that would help develop  modern workspace.
All kind of museums are interested in the digitizing of their collections not only for the sake of preserving the cultural heritage, but to also make
 the information content accessible to the wider public in a manner that is attractive, modern and is engaging the audience of different age. Evolving modern technologies, such as Virtual Reality, 
Augmented reality  and three-dimensional (3D), and even Artificial Intelligence are widely used to create virtual museum exhibitions both in a museum environment through informative media and on the internet.
 In this sense artificial intelligence is more known as machine learning systems, that can help in developing interesting, engaging, educational systems for positive experiences.

####  DIGITAL INTERACTIVE DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY
In this paragraph we will be looking into "first steps" in modernization, before looking into AI usage and implementation examples in museum environment. There are different types of digital development technologies and to 
better understand what it is and how it works, and how do they impact museum life we have to understand with what technologies we can start.
First step - using modern technologies in the museum environment, it is best to start with one of the most common, and easier to implement technology - three-dimensional (3D). 

3D technology would be best start before advancing to AI. With 3D it would be possible to make 3D replicas with museum artefacts in digital environment.  
Why? Because, with the intense and fast development of 3D digital technology, is more and more valued by people, not only by employees but visitors of the museum too. 
At these times, it has become important part and the most important research and application direction in the field of multimedia applications used in culture. Because 3D is more intuitive than a flat image,
flat story, it can give the viewer a sense of immersion, especially for items that cannot be fully displayed for various reasons, to see them, and almost touch them.

It is as Zhen Guo mentions in his research: *"3D reconstruction of the digital virtual space is not just a demonstration carrier. It reflects the creative ideas of multimedia designers in digital form, turning this idea into visible virtual 
objects and environments, elevating the traditional browsing methods in the past to the realm of digital WYSIWYG , greatly improving browsing experience, browsing quality, and browsing efficiency."* 
 And indeed, to enhance the viewer's sense of being on the scene, it is more likely to use digital devices to access beautiful and interesting exhibits and to give knowledge introductions that cannot be accessed anytime and 
anywhere in reality. Therefore, as one of the most important features in the digital virtual reality technology, emulation has become an important subject for digital virtual reality works and multimedia designers to urgently study and 
explore.

Like I said before, it is important to start with basic things before advancing into full understanding of AI, because all these elements, like 3D, Virtual Reality or Augmented reality is part of Artificial Intelligence.
 After looking more deeper in Zhen Guo research and other researches about modernization of museums, I can conclude that most of them states same main technologies, so  there are three main Contents of Digital Interactive Display Technology
 in the Museum. In **figure 1** is simple grapfh showing these 3 main concepts. First - 3D laser scanning and modeling technology for museum cultural relics display. That is, 3Dlaser scanning and modeling technology is used for the display of cultural relics in museums.
 This is starter plan even for our museum of Riga's history and Navigation. Museums usually use photographic technology, 3D laser scanning technology, and 3D three-dimensional modeling technology to take pictures or objects, artifacts or relics that are easily damaged - such as paper, silk painting, silk fabric, bronze, or iron. 3D 
scanning is used to produce replicas similar to the artefacts in museum collection, they are made for visitors to watch and appreciate, this means, that original artifact can be in safe place, while its replica stands in the place of original for everyone to see.

**Figure 1** *Digital Interactive Display Technology. Main contents of digital interactive display technology in museum*
![Graph4](/Graph4.jpg)

The static stereo photography technology mainly shoots or scans some important objects in the collections and obtaining and creating imitation products by this type of technology, that are almost the same as original, 
with such details and ornaments, can be used for exhibition. And again, technology comes in help to minimize the damage of the original cultural artifacts. 
For the second technology I could mention multimedia information technology for museum cultural relics display. Multimedia information technology is a 
comprehensive media display technology, including traditional information dissemination media and new media. As article mentions - through the integration of text, pictures, video and audio, it can more intuitively and vividly convey 
the detailed information of cultural heritage and artifacts in the museum.  
For example, the emergence of media such as Facebook, twitter public accounts, 
Instagram, etc., makes the audience's viewing and recognition of museum scenes and collections of cultural relics not only limited to the physical objects in the museum, but also through multimedia 
videos and new media information. So, you do not have to be physically in the museum, and given times of COVID - 19, less people are coming to museums, most of them are using digital environment. 
The communication (social) platform can receive the historical object content for browsing anytime and anywhere, and can carry out interactive communication with the official media of the museum to ensure a more humane and 3D  cultural artifact display through digital space. 
And for the last one we can talk about virtual reality technology for the museum object and artifact displaying. VR is a situational simulation technology based on computer systems. 
It mainly brings the audience an "immersive" environment interaction experience through the construction of virtual applications and virtual three-dimensional models. In the scene of the virtual reality system, there are a variety
of functional modules. Different functional modules display different cultural relics scenes and collection information. The audience can freely browse the exhibits in the virtual space, using intelligent sensing devices such 
as glasses, it is possible to view the texture, structure and other details of the objects from the museum collections.

Of course, there are many museums using digital, modern technologies. Are future museums and designing futuristic museums possible? 
And will it make working in museum more productive in all kinds of fields, and will museum be better in educating students, children, everyone, but to even start steps of modernization museum must know its goal and mission. 
The rapid development of network multimedia technology and digital interactive technology provides opportunities for the digital display of the museum's existing spaces. 
And looking at all these three digital interactive ways, I can conclude, that it is needed to use them creating smart and interesting Artificial Intelligence application, system for usage in the museum, because with Artificial Intelligence, 
it would be possible, for example, to show 3D objects , with intelligence it would be even easy to distinguish collections, but of course, if the program has been prepared extensively and thoroughly. 

#### Here would be part about ArchAIDE project from the PART1 (if my topic was put in one post)

#### Let's Move on

I was looking in to the topic - Recognition through bags of visual words, ath first i found it easy to understand, but those were false feelings of mine - math happened. So for now, I will skip that part, till it is researched properly.

#### CLASSIFICATION AND RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHMS FOR THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL FRAGMENTS
If we look more into details and recognition procedures about ceramics, mostly pottery is found in archaeological sites in a broken state, especially when those pieces are of unknown organisms and irregular fragments, this may take years of hard work to research, especially hard it is in the case of loss of some pieces from object, which will require even more harder work and will need experienced archaeologists. This is problem in every museum where is archeological department. An automatic reconstruction of ancient artifact fragments is a great interest in archaeology. 
I will be looking more into specific article about  of classification and reconstruction, of the archeological objects, which is my main interest for now. Article "Classification and reconstruction algorithms for the archaeological fragments"
 by Nada A. Rasheed and Jan Mordin, states that this problem divides into two major tasks the first of which is the Classification of Archaeological Fragments into similar groups which would be CAF and the second one is the
 Reconstruction of each group into the original Archaeological Objects which is RAO.  In the end after classification and reconstruction of the archaeological objects, it is possible to work with them easier and even to make them interactive for the museum employees in archaeology department. And because people are interested a lot it archeology it would be easy to make these objects interactive for visitors too. 
Authors suggest that there is method to solve this problem, and that exploits the color and texture properties of the surfaces of the fragments (ceramic artefact fragments). 
Furthermore, the reconstruction of archaeological fragments in 3D geometry is an important problem in pattern recognition. There is needed algorithms to reconstruct real datasets using Neural Networks. 
The challenge of this is to reconstruct the objects without previous knowledge about the part that should start the assembly.
Authors proposed framework  to solve the problem of classification and reconstruction of the archeological objects (fragments). 
Their proposed idea consists of two phases - were each of them performs specific job. 

As example, we can use articles provided schema seen **figure 2**. 

Scheme of the framework of the system represents two parts of classification of Ancient fragments (CAF) and reconstruction of the Ancient Object (RAO), and as seen in scheme each set of procedures follows specific steps: (I am using provided information as authors have stated them in the article, for easily understanding)
* Standard image acquisition from the website.
* Object segmentation.
* Feature extraction depending on color and texture of the surfaces of the fragments and the globule and locale features.
* Classify fragments into groups; if it is no part of the collection, it must be returned to the dataset for re-entry so that it is suitable for grouping with other parts. However, in the case that all parts formed the group, they are moved to the next stage, which is to reconstruct the group into a single object.
The next stage includes:
* Acquisition 3D model and apply the preprocessing procedure to eliminate the noise that appears as the result of scan object, and then calculate the geometric features after extracting the contour of each part and divided into subsets.
* Identify the part that will match a pair of fragments by using Neural Network.
* Aligning the candidate 3D fragments and matching through proposed new method. If the object no complete should be brought back to the dataset. Otherwise, the procedure is finished, and the object was obtained a fully.

Article provides steps of algorithm for successfully executing procedures of the framework.  But that is not all. There is obligatory to classify these fragments into the groups, and can be summarized in these kinds of steps:

1.Image acquisition,

2.Object segmentation,

3.Feature extraction, (depending on color and texture of the surfaces of the fragments and fragments classification into groups, if the fragments doesn't belong to the group, system should bring back to the start in the dataset, to reenter input again, until it is suitable with grouping with other archeological artefacts.

4.When all the fragments have formed the group, then it means next step can start, this means, reconstructing formed group in to the one object.

In the **figure 3** there is an example with six images of the ceramic fragments, there is possible to see how object files are uploaded in the system and in the graph, we can see, step by step how algorithm starts working, for recognizing the fragments. Everything is mind of the system, because there is need to obtain object without background for more precise classification, and so does for color, texture etc. 

There are used different type of techniques, like for color extraction researches rely on the mathematical methods. For basic visual information this is more than enough to understand how this system of classification and reconstruction works. But even in this article I can see, that these are first steps, because there is need to consider size, angles and other additional features of the objects, for better reconstruction, with only type, color, material of the object you cannot reconstruct full object on few patterns.  

This article *"Classification and reconstruction algorithms for the archaeological fragments"* shows wonderful job in showing how classification and reconstruction algorithm works in regard of researching, classifying, and recreating archaeological artifacts. This example could be one of the few best techniques to use for archeologists in the museum, for better understanding and researching pottery fragments. 
There are advantages and disadvantages for solving reconstruction and classification for the objects. 
Advantage like replacing manual classification with automate one would be great step forward for grouping artifacts depending on color, or texture. 
Another advantage of this type of system would be easy object reconstruction using 2D or even 3D models, automatically avoiding damaging more present object, and would reduce human recourses for classification job with hands.
 There are number of methods to use in classifying archeological ceramic fragments, their color, texture, the information of the surface. 
But the problem would be with avoiding gaps in the reconstructed object, because not all the fragments are preserved (to avoid gaps is inevitable), in consideration should be taken, that reconstruction would not be always accurate 100%, but using right techniques, it is possible to achieve 96% accuracy of identification and even reconstruction of chosen object.
Of course, there are other articles with framework system creations not only in classification in the pottery, but in timeline itself, where is used different type of algorithms - network system or mathematical modeling system.

### Conclusion? Not so much. But there will be one! Just some thoughts.

Thousands of exhibits exist in most museums. How to preserve and display many exhibits has become an important issue for museum construction and exhibition. 
With the development of modern digital technology and speech coding technology, museum exhibition and presentation methods are also more diversified. The joint participation of visual, auditory, tactile, and other sensory 
experiences will leave a deep and strong impression on the audience. Therefore, the use of multimedia, three-dimensional modeling, virtual reality and other technologies can more three-dimensional present more authentic and 
rich details of cultural relics or collections, bringing a stronger sense of sensory impact and providing a comprehensive and three-dimensional Display the real environment and cultural relics information of the museum.

Topic is about 'possibilities' of implementation of Artificial Intelligence in the museum because it is hard work where are needed finances, projects and understanding, and the desire to achieve planned. 
There are a lot of research about modern technology influence on culture and life of the museums. It is important to understand and research these modern tendencies, to even start implementing these modern ideas in museum.
The first steps in using Artificial Intelligence in the museum environment is to start with more basic technologies like digital interactive display technologies, and to work and move to more complicated and advanced technology, 
with the help of projects similar to ArchAIDE's. And because of the lack of digital technology knowledge in all of our museum departments it would be wise to start with archeology's department, because most of the artefacts are so old, 
that they can be barely kept safe, and even the smallest digitalization with 3d and artificial intelligence, would ease the job afterwards.

In the museum collection we have thousands of pottery fragments, which mostly make incomplete objects when they are reconstructed, and because of lack of right technology and programs and knowledge, 
it is not possible to replicate and "finish" the look of the historical authentic object, saving them in database type catalogue, for further work and research. So as for a step forward it would be use sort of framework algorithms 
with step-by-steps creating classification for archaeological collections in the museum for further reconstructions, and working this system together with project like ArchAIDE, it would be good experience in theoretical and practical area.
